# NetliFridays

Have a Netlify question? Stuck with a project and want debug help?

I will do Office Hours every Friday to help Netlify users, including by Zoom or Google Hangouts chat.

Make an issue here with what help you need and maybe a repro of your problem, as well as a high-bandwidth way to get in touch with you to arrange a call e.g. via Twitter DM or email. If your problem can be resolved without a call, I'll do that first.

All calls are recorded. There will be other office hours available to you if you are not comfortable with recordings, as well as https://community.netlify.com/ where community support is available to you. Also check out [the JAMslack for our Slack community.](https://jamstack.org/slack)

This is an experiment. Feedback welcome!
